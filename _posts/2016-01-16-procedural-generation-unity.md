title: \[GameDev\] Procedurally Generated Meshes
---

I wanted to move over some images I had from my old blog onto this one so they don't get lost. These are from early 2016 where I was learning and playing around with procedural generation, specifically with terrains. I loved the low poly look so I stuck with the non-shared vertex faces. Most of these were just fun projects to run around in and learn new things. 

Starting out with generating vertexes and applying meshes

Some images showing off the generated noise. I got the library to generate this noise from [here](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/LibNoise.Unity)

To make it easy and fast to update these meshes on the fly I chunked them into 20x20 grids

Later on I wanted to generate terrain for a standalone island ala [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/)

I then came up with an idea for procedurally coloring the mesh based on height and really liked the look of the result. I would pick a pixel off a texture image based on altitude and location and set the UV of the triangle to that. Here's the image I used.

And here's the result:
